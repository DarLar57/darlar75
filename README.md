I have a Postgraduate degree in IT (finished in '19) by PJATK in Warsaw that coverred among others HTML, CSS, JAVA, SQL, but also Master degree by SGH (Warsaw) in Finance and Banking.
I have certificates of Web Dev Prog (Front and Back ends) by W3School as well that coverred PHP, JS, SQL, CSS, HTML.
I worked in Treasury/Fin. for years (resigned from my profession) and decided to reorient professionally to IT - coding. 
For a few past months I've developed some projects (to further learn and have a portfolio) using HTML, CSS, BS5, JS (incl. jQ), PHP, SQL of which I have fundamental i.r. basic knowledge. I learned also JAVA for many months. 
Iâ€™m determined, committed, logically thinking, and like to learn and achieve set objectives. Now my goal #1 is to start work as Junior/Entry Full Stack Dev. 
Available to start in ~ week time.
