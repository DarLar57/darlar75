I’m darlar57 - the two digits do not mean when born :).
I have a Master degree by SGH (Warsaw) in Finance and Banking.
I’ve been working in Finance for several years and currently employed.
As I've been interested in Java, while working I also completed 1 year demanding post-graduate IT studies (JAVA, SQL, HTML, CSS etc.) by PJATK in Warsaw in '19.
I still learn Java in free time.
I’m determined and ready to take a new challange of becoming Junior Jave developer, working in remote mode.
No issue for me to start my new job from "entry" level and hope to learn fast and grow in a new role.
